Starting out with first game to get fundamentals of Unity down

# Real Intent
When starting out learning how to code, I had a game idea in mind, but knew nothing about making it happen and sure as hell knew that
no one else would make it. So I jumped into all of this with the intent of making this idea of mine, however after going through uni and
graduating then finding work, I lost sight of it and learnt programming and techniques that would assist with real reliable jobs that
people are actually willing to pay for.

Now I'm just doing this in my own time so that one day maybe this can be something. See how we go.
